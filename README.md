Class: Java 23
Teacher: Muhannad Satouf
```


## Description
In this assignment I have created a server - client application whilst using modern security technologies. In this application you can create a user with a hashed password (using Bcrypt), log in and authenticate using JWT tokens, save encrypted messages (using AES) in the database and see your saved messages decrypted. 
<br>
### Functionality
- Create a user
- Log in
- Save your messages
- Explore through a console application choosing to write a message or read your prevoius messeages 
- Log out
- All data is saved in a phpMyAdmin database using MySQL

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Clone the repo: (https://github.com/JoBch/IT_SAKERHET_JAVA23_Joel_Bech_Uppgift2)
- Start your choice of IDE compatiable with Java and Java SpringBoot (Intellij was used during production)
- Run the project


## Project features
Log in - using JWT and MySql to verify user
<br>
<br>
Register - using Bcrypt for hashing of the password
<br>
<br>
Write an encrypted new message uisng AES
<br>
<br>
Watch your decrypted messeages using AES
<br>
<br>
## Technologies Used
- Java SpringBoot
- Java (language)
- Bcrypt (hashing)
- JWT
- AES (encryption & decryption)
- phpMyAdmin database
- MySQL
